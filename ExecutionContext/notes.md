# Execution Context #

```
In JavaScipt everything will run on the execution context. In the EC we have memory phase and code phase memory phase is nothing but variable Environment and  code phase is nothing but thread of execution.

In memory phase variables and functions will be stored as key value pair in code phase the code will be executed one line at a  time.
