# Hoisting #

```
Hoisting is a javascript mechanism which is used to handle async operations. Where variable declarations and function declarations will be moved to the top of their scope.That means we can use the variables and functions before it was declared. In hoisting process only function declarations will be hoisted.
and variables with var only hoisted.
